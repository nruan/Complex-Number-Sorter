# Complex-Number-Sorter
Complex number sorter, adder, and multiplier. Reads in an input file from an input file with the complex numbers formatted as:
"13.4+14i". This program demontrates my ability to work with built in C++ libraries, classes, and operator overloading  among 
other things. This was completed for my programming languages class.
